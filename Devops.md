## Topics for Research activity
- Research and create reports on following topics
  - What is SRE - Site Reliatbility Engineer ?

  SRE teams are responsible for how code is deployed, configured, and monitored, as well as the availability, latency, change management, emergency response, and capacity management of services in production.

  Focus - system availability and reliability, continuity and speed of product developemnt and delivery
  Goal - bridge gap between development and operations 

  - Are SRE and DevOps same or different, if different then how?

  While DevOps aims to handle runtime errors and allow teams to learn from them, SRE enforces error management through Service Level Commitments (SLx) to ensure all failures are handled. SRE also allows for a risk budget that allows teams to test the limits of failure for reevaluation and innovation.

This highlights various differences in how the concepts operate, including:

Goal: Both SRE and DevOps aim to bridge the gap between development and operations, though SRE involves prescriptive ways of achieving reliability, while DevOps works as a template that guides collaboration.

Focus: Site reliability engineering mainly focuses on enhancing system availability and reliability while DevOps focuses on speed of development and delivery while enforcing continuity.

Team structure: An SRE team is composed of site reliability engineers who have a background in both operations and development. DevOps teams include a variety of roles, including QA experts, developers, engineers, SREs and many others.

  - Various tools for setting DevOps?

  Slack
  Docker
  GitHub

- Make sure each group have a git account, if none in the group have Github accounts please make one

- Reports should be in markdown form. If you want to know more about markdown use this (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
